Introduction
  Context and motivation
  Problems to be addressed
  	- With the advacement of computer and software technologies, it's quite easy to find out choices for a dinner. However, there's no single system where we can get all information required for the whole event. We use Yelp/Google to find list of restaurant nearby or to read review about the restaurant, and use different system such as Google Maps/Uber to look for directions and transporation services. We are trying to develop an innovative system where user can look up in one single system to get all detail to plan a dinner/lunch.

  Data Sources
  		The systems utilizes data from multiple data sources through Web services. The following Web services API are used in the project,
  		1. Uber API
  			- Populate list of available Uber taxis at a particular location based on geometric co-ordinates
  			- Estimate on the time expected to get the taxi at the start point
  			- Price estimate for the entire travel base on the geometric co-ordinates of start and end location
  		2. Yelp API
  			- Retrieve restaurant list based on user's query. Ex: "Restaurants in buffalo"
  			- Populate more details on each result such as address/contact/cuisine/rating/review count/deals/geometric co-ordinates etc.
  			- Sort results based on ratings/distance
		3. Google Maps API
			- Populate dynamic map with poiinters for search results
			- Provide directions from start to end locations for each query result
		4. Google Places API
			- Retrieve details such as reviews, ratings, photo etc. for query result
			- Near by suggestions based on the selected query result 
		5. Google directions API
			- Retrieve public transit info such as route, public trasit details (next and future), time estimate etc. based on start and stop locations
		
		Detailed information on the API's that will be used in the system is collected and desribed as a matrix below,
